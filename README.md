This repository demonstrates a common Firebase error: data type mismatches. The `firebaseBug.js` file showcases code that attempts to access data with an incorrect type assumption, leading to unexpected behavior.  `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides a solution using type checking and error handling to mitigate this issue.  This is a crucial aspect of robust Firebase app development.
